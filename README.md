Analyzing promotions and provide tangible insights to Sales Director
Atliq Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their Atliq branded products.
Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.
Sales director wanted this immediately but the analytics manager is engaged on another critical project. So, he decided to give this work to curious data analyst at Atliq Mart believing that he will help him in finding the results and make the insights clear and easy to understand .
